This naturally means that things will be difficult, as time goes on. One can even say that you can compare any tests and activities you will take to that of a video game.","\n",{"#":"background:classroom"},{"#":"character:Professor Mary"},"^For instance, during an exam, you’ll be battling out monsters to help increase your level. As your level increases, your chances of passing through the stage increases as well.","\n",{"#":"background:classroom"},{"#":"character:Professor Mary"},"^You can make use of items and consumables to further aid you in your battles. However, keep in mind that each stage contains a final boss in the final exams. Defeat it and you’ll be able to proceed onwards to the next stage.","\n",{"#":"background:classroom"},{"#":"character:Professor Mary"},"^Oh! And please add this to your notes. You are only able to fight the final boss once you have completed the needed requirements.","\n",{"#":"background:classroom"},{"#":"character:Student 1"},"^That sounds really boring, sir.

There has to be something more than that.","\n",{"#":"background:classroom"},{"#":"character:Professor Mary"},"^Yes. There’s a series of school events that will help you level up even more. You can think of them as extra credits, as long as you have the motivation to participate in them. Perhaps, you might receive valuable items that can help you in the future.","\n",{"#":"background:classroom"},{"#":"thoughts"},"^... What is he talking about?","\n",{"#":"background:classroom"},{"#":"character:Professor Mary"},"^I’ve explained everything that needs to be addressed. Are there any questions? Violent reactions?

Look, I’m going to be honest with you. This program is not easy at all. I mean sure, every program is difficult in its own way but this is another whole level of difficulty. I’ve seen students every year who shifted to another program, transferred to another school, or dropped out because of how difficult it was.”","\n",{"#":"background:locker2"},{"#":"character:Player"},"^Yikes! It was that bad?","\n",{"#":"background:locker2"},{"#":"character:Justine"},"^Yeah. But hey, I didn’t mean to scare you or anything. Knowing you, I personally think that you can handle this program better than I do. Oh! And if you’re planning to purchase something from the vending machine, stay away from number 17. It tastes really bad. Bleh.","\n",{"#":"background:locker2"},{"#":"character:Player"},"^... Ha ha ha. Alright senpai. I’ll keep those words in mind.","\n",{"#":"background:locker2"},{"#":"character:Justine's friend"},"^Oi Justine.
